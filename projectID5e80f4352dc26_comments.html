<HTML><BODY>This book presents a collection of Xhosa folk-lore collected in the nineteenth century (The title uses the word "Kaffir", which was normally used at the time, and used here without negative intent, but that has become unacceptable today, similar in status to "Nigger" in the US. However, for historical accuracy, we preserve the term, when transcribing this text.)

<p>Unlike the book of San Folklore currently also in PGDP, this book only contains English text, and thus is fairly easy, which only the occasional Xhosa word appearing. Although Xhosa uses some click-letters as well, they are simply represented by the letters c (ǀ), q (ǃ), and x (ǁ). If you wonder what that sounds like, listen to the Xhosa "click" song popularized by Miriam Makeba. Nelson Mandela also belonged to the Xhosa people.
